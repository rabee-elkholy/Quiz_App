# Quiz_App
Simple quiz app.

# How to use these files:

The attached files do NOT work as a standalone project.
Instead, you should use them to compare my code (in the lib/ folder, as well as the pubspec.yaml file) to your code. Experience shows, that this helps you spot + fix 99% of all errors you might encounter.
If you want to run the code, you can do that as well though.
### Follow these steps:
  1) Create a new Flutter project via flutter create same_project_name (quiz_app).
  2) Replace the lib/ folder and the pubspec.yaml file with the attached files.
  3) flutter packages get.
  4) flutter run (with a running emulator or real device connected to your machine) to view the app.
